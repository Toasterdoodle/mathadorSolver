# mathadorSolver

A small coding project I made to solve a brain teaser for me. The question attempting to be solved is this: given a number a, and a list of numbers b, is there a way to create a using all the numbers in b and the 4 operators +, -, *, /. This small program just brute forces it and checks for every combination.
